Introduction============
This plugin extends jQuery with a small boilerplate framework for development according to the classic Model-View-Controller architectural pattern. The focus of this plugin is on keeping things light and flexible, and not forcing the programmer into the architecture of a full framework. There are no restriction by having to 'buy into' any architecture or library other than jQuery core itself and the plugin's MVC boilerplate, which - because of re-use of established practices - will feel largely reminiscent of jQuery UI widgets.
